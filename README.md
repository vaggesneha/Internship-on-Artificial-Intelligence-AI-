# Internship-on-Artificial-Intelligence-AI-
Course completed on Artificial intelligence (AI) using Google Colabaratory. The following attachment consists of a "Major project and Minor project", which I had acquire understanding of how AI works.

###MAJOR PROJECT:

Description:
A simple real time application, creating a model that will be able to recognize and determine a face( with mask or without mask )from its image by using the concepts of Artificial Neural Network.

Technologies Used: PYTHON from Zebo.AI

Installation:

-!git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 # clone

-pip install -r requirements.txt #install

Usage:

-Display the image either with mask or without mask.

-To fetch the image 'import' the image.

-In show the image with mask or without mask.

Additional Notes: Future updates will include support for multiple objects and extended for video detection.

###MINOR PROJECT:

Description:
Creating a model that will be able to recognize and determine the handwritten digits from its image by using the concepts of Artificial Neural Network.

Technologies Used: PYTHON

Installation:

-import tensorflow

-import matplotlib.pyplot

Usage: Performing a digit classification to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images from the MNIST dataset from keras and creating a neutral network.

Additional Notes: Used in applications of cameras based apps, edge dectection healthcare and facial recognition.
